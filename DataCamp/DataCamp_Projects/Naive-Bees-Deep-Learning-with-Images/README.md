# **Project Description** 
**Naïve Bees: Deep Learning with Images** 

Can a machine distinguish between a honey bee and a bumble bee? Being able to identify bee species from images, while challenging, would allow researchers to more quickly and effectively collect field data. In this project, we will build a simple deep learning model that can automatically detect honey bees and bumble bees, then load a pre-trained model for evaluation. We will use [keras](https://keras.io/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html), [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/), and [numpy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.2/reference/), among other popular Python libraries.

This project is the third part of a series of projects that walk through working with image data, building classifiers using traditional techniques, and leveraging the power of deep learning for computer vision.
