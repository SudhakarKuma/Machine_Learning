# **Project Description** 
**Reducing Traffic Mortality in the USA** 

While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing.

By looking at the demographics of traﬃc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?

## Project Tasks

* The raw data files and their format
* Read in and get an overview of the data
* Create a textual and a graphical summary of the data
* Quantify the association of features and accidents
* Fit a multivariate linear regression
* Perform PCA on standardized data
* Visualize the first two principal components
* Find clusters of similar states in the data
* KMeans to visualize clusters in the PCA scatter plot
* Visualize the feature differences between the clusters
* Compute the number of accidents within each cluster
* Make a decision when there is no clear right choice
