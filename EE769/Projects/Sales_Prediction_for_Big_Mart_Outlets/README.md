## Sales Prediction for Big Mart Outlets
The data scientists at **BigMart** have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The aim is to build a predictive model and predict the sales of each product at a particular outlet.
